 NOTE: A longer forecast horizon is required by the SEATS signal extraction
       procedure, so the number of forecasts generated by this run has
       been changed to 36.

 NOTE: Since the trading day coefficients are fixed in the sliding spans
       analysis, the trading day statistics of the sliding spans analysis
       are not printed.

       In addition, the spans statistics for the seasonally adjusted
       series have the same values as the corresponding statistics
       for the seasonal factors.  In this case, the statistics for the
       seasonally adjusted series are not printed.

 NOTE: The default starting date of the forecast history analysis has been
       used since it is later than the default starting date determined by
       the length of the maximum seasonal filter from the seasonal adjustment.
