 NOTE: A longer forecast horizon is required by the SEATS signal extraction
       procedure, so the number of forecasts generated by this run has
       been changed to 36.
  
 NOTE: Not enough data to perform sliding spans analysis.
       Must be able to form at least two sliding spans.
 NOTE: The default starting date of the forecast history analysis has been
       used since it is later than the default starting date determined by
       the length of the maximum seasonal filter from the seasonal adjustment.
